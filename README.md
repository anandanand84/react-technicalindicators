# react-technicalindicators
Testing "technicalindicators" package in React

https://github.com/anandanand84/technicalindicators

Instructions:

* git clone https://github.com/whittlem/react-technicalindicators
* npm install
* npm run start

Note:

This code will produce a test result which you can see in the browser console but it also produces a number of errors which I'm trying to resolve.
